# SplitDiff

SplitDiff is a fast, single-page, in-browser diff viewer inspired by IDE split diffs. It runs entirely client-side and supports drag-and-drop, paste, and file pickers for quick comparisons.

**Highlights**
1. Side-by-side diff with syntax highlighting and automatic language detection.
2. Drag-and-drop, paste, or file picker import with friendly empty-state actions.
3. Tabs with localStorage persistence and quick tab management.
4. Scroll sync, optional line wrap, and a horizontal scrollbar for long lines.
5. Hunk navigation (first/prev/next/last) plus reviewed/unreviewed tracking.
6. Jump to the matching line in the opposite pane with a single click.
7. Ignore whitespace-only changes for cleaner comparisons.
8. Collapse and expand unchanged regions.
9. Search within the diff with next/previous navigation.
10. Copy left or right file contents to the clipboard.
